# ChassisPHP

Pronounced Cha-see <br>
Yes, another PHP framework. The goal with ChassisPHP is to be a framework that simplifies the process of creating a brouchure-type website.
**We are just getting started. This package is not yet production-ready!**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
It's recommended that you use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install ChassisPHP.

```bash
$ composer require rogercreasy/chassis-php
```
This will install ChassisPHP and all required dependencies. We recommend PHP 7.1 or newer.

Alternatively, Git clone the repo to your local system and start from there.

## Style, etc.
We follow PSR-2 for coding style, PSR-4 autoloading, and PSR-11 for containers.
We also believe in the use of the Oxford comma (see the above line).  :-)
